Varnish cache.

Sample pillars
==============

Single varnish service

.. code-block:: yaml

    varnish:
      server:
        enabled: true
        version: 4.0
        lookup:
          varnish_leonardo_majklk:
            type: leonardo
            name: leonardo_majklk
            bind:
              port: 7000
              host: 0.0.0.0
            backend:
              gunicorn1:
                host: localhost
                port: 80

And Supervisor like this:: yaml

    supervisor:
      server:
        service:
          varnish_leonardo_majklk:
            name: leonardo_majklk
            type: varnish

Note: This formulas runs varnish processes under supervisor instead of init script.

Using nginx type:: yaml

    nginx:
      server:
        site:
          leonardo_majklk:
            enabled: true
            type: varnish
            name: varnish_leonardo_majklk
            host:
              name: domain.com
